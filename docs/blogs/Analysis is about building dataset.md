# The Art of Data Modeling: The Hidden Analysis Behind Every Analysis

When we think of data analysis, we often envision complex dashboards, charts, and reports that reveal insights and drive decision-making. But there's a crucial, often-overlooked component that underpins all of these outputs: the data model.

The design and creation of a data model isn’t just a technical exercise—it's intrinsic to the analysis itself. In fact, you could say that building a data model is the first step in any meaningful analysis. By deciding what to model, how to structure relationships, and which metrics to define, you are already conducting analysis, shaping the story that your data can tell and will tell.

## The Role of Data Modeling in Analysis

When you create a data model, you're not just setting up a technical framework—you’re making critical decisions about how to represent the world through data. You’re deciding what’s important, what connections matter, and what insights should emerge. Every relationship you define between entities, every metric you choose to calculate, every property you label as crucial—all of these steps are part of the analytical process.

In many ways, creating a data model is analysis. As you map out the structure of your data, you’re already performing a deep exploration of the problem at hand. You’re thinking about the questions you want to answer and setting the stage for future insights. This is why data modeling isn’t just a precursor to analysis—it’s an integral part of it.

## The Challenge of Data Modeling

However, data modeling can be cumbersome.

Models can be rigid, in a sense that it takes a lot of work and a lot of changes in SQL query to make a change that looks minor on the surface. This, obviously, takes time and limits the tempo and success of explorative part of data analysis.

The second issue comes from repeating this process over long period of time. It is bound to create mess in the database. Once the analaysis "merries" data model to the presentation, this will likely become another thing to maintain for months to come. 

All this leads to probably the most important issue for the analyst doing the exploration: modeling step and analysis step become more and more detatched. This is never a good thing and I would argue that similarly an analyst should always be a part of the design team creating the solution. 

On the other end of spectrum when the time between building a data model and doing an analysis shrinks to zero, one can work with uniterrupted flow of thougts, there are no more two steps - there is only the strong focus and unlimited possibilities not constrained by technical limitation.

## Asemic: Bridging the Gap Between Modeling and Analysis

Asemic provides a unique approach that makes data modeling more accessible, flexible, and intrinsically tied to the analytical process. Here's how:

### 1. Simple and Expressive Modeling System

Asemic offers a straightforward yet powerful system for defining your data model. Instead of grappling with complex SQL schemas, you can define your model using intuitive concepts like:

- User Actions
- User Properties
- KPIs
- Time

This approach allows business users and analysts to directly translate their understanding of the business into a functional data model, without needing deep technical expertise.

Strangely enough, the last point might be the most challenging, as SQL typically does not understand Time as a separate concept, but Asemic creates an overlay of logic over SQL that allows simple time manipulation, like [Time Travel](link to Time Travel page) for User properties

### 2. Mirrored in the Application

What truly sets Asemic apart is how the modeling system is mirrored in the application interface. This means that as you're performing analysis, you can extend and refine your data model on the fly. What you effectivelly get is the strong, well tested core that was formally defined and materialized in the database and soft, maleable outer layer that you can define ad-hoc in order to suit your train of thoughts during an analysis.

For instance, if you're in the middle of analyzing user engagement and realize you need a new way to segment the data, you can define it right there in the interface. This new property becomes part of your data model, immediately available for use in your current analyses. This happens seamlessly, hiding the fact that you effectivelly changed the data model with 500 new lines of SQL.

### 3. Ad Hoc Model Extension

The ability to extend your model ad hoc is a game-changer. It means your data model can evolve as your understanding deepens and new questions arise. This flexibility allows for:

- Rapid iteration on ideas
- Testing new hypotheses without committing to permanent model changes
- Collaborative model development as different team members contribute their insights

### 4. Seamless Transition from Modeling to Analysis

With Asemic, the line between data modeling and analysis becomes blurred—in a good way. As you model your data, you're simultaneously setting up the framework for your analysis. And as you analyze, you're refining and extending your model.

This tight feedback loop between modeling and analysis leads to more insightful, relevant, and adaptable analytics. 

Once something proves useful enough, it can be formally introduced into the core model, or left to forever live as ad-hoc, efemeral entity whose lifetime aligns with the interest in the dashboard presenting the idea. No "junk" in the database.

## A New Paradigm for the Data-Driven Insights

By recognizing data modeling as an integral part of the analytical process and providing tools that seamlessly blend modeling with analysis, Asemic is pioneering a new approach to product analytics.

This approach empowers teams to:
- Iterate faster on their data models
- Align their analyses more closely with business realities
- Collaborate more effectively across technical and non-technical roles
- Derive deeper, more nuanced insights from their data

In the end, Asemic's innovative approach to data modeling doesn't just make analysis easier—it makes it more powerful, more flexible, and more aligned with the dynamic nature of modern businesses. By breaking down the barriers between data modeling and analysis, Asemic is helping teams unlock the full potential of their data, driving more informed decisions and better business outcomes.
